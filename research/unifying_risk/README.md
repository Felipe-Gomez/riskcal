## Code for "Unifying Re-Identification, Attribute Inference, and Data Reconstruction Risks in Differential Privacy."

This is the accompanying code to the paper "[Unifying Re-Identification, Attribute Inference, and Data
Reconstruction Risks in Differential Privacy.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06969)".  The notebook
contains all the simulations and analyses from the main body of the paper. The results can be
reproduced either locally or using Google Colab.  For the local installation, use `uv` to set up the
environment:
```
uv sync
```

Use jupytext to obtain the notebook from the Python file:
```
jupytext simulation_code.py --to ipynb
```

Additionally, you can upload and run the notebook in Google Colab.
